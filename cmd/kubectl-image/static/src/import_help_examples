  This is a valid command usage:

  kubectl image import					\
	--source docker.io/library/fedora:latest	\
	--mirror					\
	--insecure-source				\
	-n devel					\
	fedora 

  The command above imports image docker.io/library/fedora:latest
  into an Image called fedora in the devel namespace.

  Mirror informs Shipwright image controller that we need to mirror
  the image into our mirror registry while Insecure Source informs
  that TLS checks should be omitted when reaching the remote registry.

  To create a tag to hash map for a given image without mirroring it
  you can use the following command:

  kubectl image import					\
	--source docker.io/library/fedora:latest	\
	--no-mirror					\
	--insecure-source				\
	-n devel					\
	fedora
