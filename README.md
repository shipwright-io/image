### Motivation

Keeping track of all Container Images in use in a Kubernetes cluster is a complicated task.
Container Images may come from numerous different Image Registries. In some cases, controlling
how a stable version of a given Container Image looks escapes the user's authority. To add to
this, Container Runtimes rely on remote registries (from the cluster's point of view) when
obtaining Container Images, potentially making the process of pulling their blobs (manifests,
config, and layers) slower.

The notion of indexing Container Image versions by "tags" is helpful. Still it does not provide
users with the right confidence to always pull the intended Container Image â€“ today's "latest"
tag may not be tomorrow's "latest" tag. In addition to that, these Image Registries allow access
to Container Images by their Manifest content's hash (i.e., usually sha256), which gives users the
confidence at a cost in semantics.

When releasing a new version of an application to Push and to Deploy are split into two distinct
steps. Both the pusher and the puller need access to the same Image Registry, adding complexity.
Credentials are one example of the concerns. Other factors may pop up when running, for instance,
in an air-gapped environment, where the cluster may not be ablt to reach external Registries.

Shipwright Images aims to overcome these caveats by providing an image management abstraction
layer.  For instance, by providing a direct mapping between a Container Image tag (e.g., "latest")
and its correspondent Manifest content's hash.

When integrated with an Internal or Mirror Registry, Shipwright Images allows users to mirror
remotely hosted images into the cluster and to push or pull Images directly without requiring an
external Image Registry. It works as a layer between the user and the Internal or Mirror Registry.

In summary, Shipwright Images mirrors remote Container Images into a Kubernetes cluster, provides
an interface allowing users to pull and push images directly to the Kubernetes cluster.

### Some concepts

Images in remote repositories are tagged using a string (e.g. `latest`), these tags are not
permanent (i.e. the repository owner may push a new version for a tag at any given time).
Luckily users can also refer to images by their hashes (generally sha256) therefore one can
either pull an image using its tag (`docker.io/fedora:latest`) or utilizing its hash
(`docker.io/fedora@sha256:0123...`). Shipwright Images takes advantage of this registry feature
and creates references to image tags using their respective hashes (a hash, in such a scenario,
may be considered a "fixed point in time" for a given image tag). Every time one imports an
image Shipwright Images creates a new reference for that image tag,

### Usage examples

In order to use `kubectl image` you gonna need to install `kubectl-image` plugin, there is
a section below showing how to properly compile it. The following command mirrors into the
cluster a Container Image hosted in quay.io:

```
$ kubectl image import operator --from quay.io/shipwright/imgctrl:latest --mirror
```

Users can observe the mirror process by inspected the created ImageImport object:

```
$ kubectl get imageimports.shipwright.io
NAME         INSECURE   MIRROR   TARGETIMAGE   IMPORTEDAT             IMAGEREFERENCE
operator-0   false      true     operator      2022-02-06T19:06:24Z   mirror.registry/ns/name@sha
```

Once the ImageImport got processed its `status.hashReference.imageReference` property will be not
empty. After a while the result of the import/mirror will be copied to an image called `operator`,
users can observe this by inspecting the `operator` image inside the same namespace:

```
$ kubectl get images.shipwright.io operator -o yaml
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: operator
  namespace: namespace
spec:
  from: quay.io/shipwright/imgctrl:latest
  insecure: false
  mirror: true
status:
  hashReferences:
  - from: quay.io/shipwright/imgctrl:latest
    imageReference: mirror.registry/ns/name@<sha>
    importedAt: "2022-02-06T19:06:24Z"
```

Once you have an Image created you don't need to provide the `--from` flag if you want to import
the image from the same repository again. Imagining that eventually `operator:latest` will differ
from the version we just mirrored users can issue the following command:

```
$ kubectl image import operator
```

This command will locate an Image called `operator` and mirror it again. Once again we will have
an ImageImport object being processed by Shipwright Images and eventually the `operator` Image
will be updated to contain a second `hashReference` (the result of the new mirror command):

```
$ kubectl get images.shipwright.io operator -o yaml
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: operator
  namespace: namespace
spec:
  from: quay.io/shipwright/imgctrl:latest
  insecure: false
  mirror: true
status:
  hashReferences:
  - from: quay.io/shipwright/imgctrl:latest
    imageReference: mirror.registry/ns/name@<another-sha>
    importedAt: "2022-02-06T19:09:24Z"
  - from: quay.io/shipwright/imgctrl:latest
    imageReference: mirror.registry/ns/name@<sha>
    importedAt: "2022-02-06T19:06:24Z"
```

Once ImportImage objects have been fully processed and are already showing up inside an Image
object they can be safely deleted from the cluster.

### Mirroring images

Shipwright Images allows administrators to mirror images locally within the cluster. You need to
have an image registry running inside the cluster (or anywhere else) and ask `Shipwright Images`
to do the mirror.  By doing so a copy of the remote image is going to be made into the mirror
registry.

### Shipwright Images Image CRD structure

Shipwright Images leverages a _custom resource definition_ called Image. An Image represents
an image tag in a remote registry. For instance, a Image called `myapp-devel` may be created to
keep track of the image `quay.io/company/myapp:devel`. An Image _custom resource_ layout looks
like this:

```yaml
$ kubectl get images.shipwright.io operator -o yaml
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: myapp-devel
  namespace: namespace
spec:
  from: quay.io/company/myapp:devel
  insecure: false
  mirror: true
status:
  hashReferences:
  - from: quay.io/company/myapp:devel
    imageReference: mirror.registry.io/namespace/myapp-devel@<sha>
    importedAt: "2022-02-06T19:06:24Z"
```

On an Image `.spec` property the following fields are valid:

| Property   | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| from       | Indicates the source of the image (from where Shipwright Images should import it) |
| mirror     | Informs if the Image should be mirrored to another registry                       |
| insecure   | Skip tls verification during the image import/mirror                              |

Follow below the properties found on an Image`.status` property and their meaning:

| Name              | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hashReferences    | A list of all imported references (aka generations)                        |

The property `.status.hashReferences` is an array of imports executed, Shipwright Images currently
holds up to twenty five references for any given image. Every item on the array is composed of the
following properties:

| Name           | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| from           | From where this image was imported, generally points to an image by tag       |
| importedAt     | Date and time of the import                                                   |
| imageReference | Where this reference points to (by sha), may point to the mirror registry     |

### Shipwright Images ImageImport CRD structure

Users can import new Images by creating instances of ImageImport custom resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: ImageImport
metadata:
  name: myapp-0
spec:
  from: docker.io/library/nginx:latest
  insecure: false
  mirror: false
  targetImage: nginx
status:
  hashReference:
    from: docker.io/library/nginx:latest
    imageReference: <redacted>
    importedAt: "2022-02-06T20:37:46Z"
  importAttempts:
  - succeed: true
    when: "2022-02-06T20:37:46Z"
```

The field `.spec.targetImage` is mandatory. All other `.spec` fields are optional and if not
provided their values are inherited from the Image pointed by `.spec.targetImage`. The status
of an ImageImport CR shows the result of all attempts made to import the image under the field
`.status.importAttempts`. Ten attempts are made to import an Image.

In case of success during the import the `.status.hashReference` contains the image reference,
its fields are:

| Name           | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| from           | From where this image was imported, generally points to an image by tag       |
| importedAt     | Date and time of the import                                                   |
| imageReference | Where this reference points to (by hash), may point to the mirror registry    |

As for `.status.importAttempts` the following is valid:

| Name    | Description                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| when    | Date and time of the import attempt                                                  |
| succeed | A boolean indicating if the import was successful or not                             |
| reason  | In case of failure (succeed = false), what was the error                             |


#### Mirroring images locally

If mirroring is set in an Image, Shipwright Images will mirror the image content into another
registry provided by the user.  To mirror images locally one needs to inform Shipwright Images
about the mirror registry location. You can configure the mirror registry location through a
Secret called `mirror-registry-config` in the Shipwright Images namespace, this secret may
contain the following properties:

| Name       | Description                                                                       |
| -----------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| address    | The mirror registry URL                                                           |
| insecure   | Allows Shipwright Images to access insecure registry if set to "true" (string)    |

Credentials to access the mirror registry are read from the target namespace, in other words: if
you want to mirror an image in the namespace "prod" you have to have valid push credentials inside
the "prod" namespace.

You can read more on how to create a registry secret here:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/

Follow below an example of a `mirror-registry-config` Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mirror-registry-config
  namespace: shipwright
data:
  address: cmVnaXN0cnkuaW8=
```

#### Importing images from private registries

Shipwright Images supports importing images from private registries, for that to work one needs to
define a secret with the registry credentials on the same Namespace where the Image lives. This
secret must be of type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. You can find more information about these
secrets at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/

### Deploying

_The documentation below may not be the right one for the version you want to install.  It is
recommended that you refer to the documentation specific to the version you are willing to deploy.
Download a file called `README.pdf` or `README.md` for the release in the Releases section of this
repository._

You can deploy Shipwright Images using Helm, let's first select the release we want to install
by running the following commands:

```
$ RELEASE=v2.1.17
$ BASEURL=https://github.com/shipwright-io/image/releases/download
```
The `RELEASE` variable may be set to any release, to see a full list of releases follow the link
https://github.com/shipwright/image/releases. Once the release is chosen and the variables are set
you can then procceed to install the operator by running:

```
$ helm install imgctrl $BASEURL/$RELEASE/imgctrl-$RELEASE.tgz
```

You can also get a list of what can be customized during the install by running the following
command:

```
$ helm show values $BASEURL/$RELEASE/imgctrl-$RELEASE.tgz
```

By default Shipwright Images won't be able to mirror until you provide it with a mirror registry
config.  After install you can configure the mirror by editing the Secret `mirror-registry-config`
in the operator namespace. Follow below an example of a valid `mirror-registry-config` secret
(you gonna have to provide your own `address`, `username`, `password`, etc):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mirror-registry-config
data:
  address: cmVnaXN0cnkuaW8=
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: d2hhdCB3ZXJlIHlvdSB0aGlua2luZz8K
  token: YW4gb3B0aW9uYWwgdG9rZW4gZm9yIHRva2VuIGJhc2VkIGF1dGg=
  insecure: dHJ1ZQ==
```

You can provide your own certificate and Shipwright Images will leverage it for serving images
when users pull or push. This certificate is also used when Kubernetes asks to validate a given
Tag.  To provide your certificate use Helm chart `key` and `cert` variables. Important to
notice that the certificate must be valid for the following alternative names:

```
- mutating-webhooks.<shipwright namespace>.svc.
	- this name is used when kubernetes api server validates images.
- the ingress name.
	- users will use this to reach shipwright images when pulling or pushing.
```

If you don't provide any certificate during installation a self signed one will be created and
deployed, it is valid for one year. You can update the certificates whenever you want, for that
you need to edit a secret called `certs` in Shipwright Images's namespace and a mutating webhook
config called `imgctrl`.

```
$ kubectl edit secret certs
$ kubectl edit mutatingwebhookconfigurations imgctrl
```

### Building kubectl-image plugin

To build the kubectl image plugin you gonna need to install a few dependencies. Depending on the
distribution you are using the packages may be named differently. To install on a Fedora release
you can run the following commands (from within Shipwright Images's repository root directory):

```
sudo dnf install -y \
	make \
	go \
	gpgme-devel \
	btrfs-progs-devel \
	device-mapper-devel
make kubectl-image
sudo mv output/bin/kubectl-image /usr/local/bin/kubectl-image
```

You gonna need `go` to be at least version `1.16`. To build in an Ubuntu distribution, after
installing `go >= 1.16`, you can run the following commands:

```
sudo apt install -y \
	make \
	libbtrfs-dev \
	libgpgme-dev \
	libdevmapper-dev \
	uidmap
make kubectl-image
sudo mv output/bin/kubectl-image /usr/local/bin/kubectl-image
```
